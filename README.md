# Iron Wing Dispatching

A single-page (plus sign-up and blog) web application designed for a fictional trucking dispatch service, **Iron Wing Dispatching**. It demonstrates front-end development, basic form handling, and a simple back-end server with Node.js and Express.

## Overview
Iron Wing Dispatching is a conceptual project aimed at showcasing my abilities in:
- Responsive front-end web design (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript).
- Basic Node.js/Express server set-up.
- Simple form validation and submission flow.
- Code organization and maintainability.

The site is designed as if it were a real-world dispatch service for owner-operators and small motor carriers. It includes pages for services, pricing, blog posts, and a sign-up form. All styling is custom (no CSS frameworks), providing a good demonstration of my front-end skills.
