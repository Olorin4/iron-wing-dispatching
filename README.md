MENAS LOGISTICS WEBSITE

**Description**:
A basic static website for my dispatching company.

Plan for Upgrades: As I progress through The Odin Project:

-   Use React to make the site dynamic (e.g., load data dynamically without page refresh).
-   Use Node.js and databases to create a backend for client portals or load management.

MVP Launch (January 2025):

Use basic HTML/CSS to design a simple, professional site.
Host the site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for free.
Use placeholders for complex features I'll implement later (e.g., "Client Login - Coming Soon").
Upgrade as I Learn:

After the React course, revamp the site with modern frontend techniques.
After Node.js and Databases, add backend features like load tracking or a client portal.
Iterate and Improve:

Treat the website as a continuous project, adding functionality as my skills grow and as my business needs evolve.
